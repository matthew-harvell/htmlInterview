      <h1>HTML Layout Interview v2.3</h1>
      <div>
        These are some sample images from an image gallery. The client wishes to
        see these laid out in a few different ways to see what looks best to
        their eyes. Note that the native sizes of the images have been provided
        with a single size of 400px on the long side but they are not all in the
        same orientation. You may feel free to resize these (should you decide
        to do so that is) in the browser for the purpose of this exercise.
        Assume that the viewport will always be a laptop-sized screen (no mobile
        or giant 50 inch displays - 14 &mdash; 17 inch only) for the purpose of
        this exercise.
      </div>

      <div>
        Below there are three <code>div</code> elements. These are all colored
        to indicate their boundaries. Within each of these elements we would
        like a different layout of the five images:
        <ol>
          <li>
            The client would like to have all the images aligned on the top edge
            instead of on the bottom. Note that this might require the images to
            be resized.
          </li>
          <li>
            The client would like the images separated horizontally into columns
            with a 5px margin around each and an inset border of 2px. A shadow
            on the right and bottom side would be nice, use your judgement on
            the size and color. Perhaps some radius on the images.
          </li>
          <li>
            The client would like the images to zig-zag from upper left to the
            right and then back to lower left. Consider using one of the layout
            systems (flex, grid, etc.) General textual idea the client wrote on
            the back of a napkin at Shake Shack:
            <div>
              Image1<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image2<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image3<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image4<br />
              Image5
            </div>
            <hr />
            <div style="margin-top: 20px">
              Once that is done, you may use the remaining time to continue
              to:<br />
              - Improve the overall quality of the existing css<br />
              - Improve the visual appearance of this page<br />
              -- This could be done with color, typography, layout, transitions,
              filters, etc. It's up to you.<br /><br />
              <i>Note: You must keep the client's requests in tact</i>
            </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        You may use any native HTML or CSS elements or properties to accomplish
        this. Begin at #1 and move through to #3.
